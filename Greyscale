function [greypic] = Greyscale(picture)

%Greyscale converts a RGB image to a greyscale version by  applying a ratio
%of colours to each pixel.

%Inputs: picture: m-by-n-by-3 uint8 array of a RGB image
%Outputs: greypic: m-by-n-by-1 uint8 array of a greyscale image

%Variables for amount of rows and columns for RGB image array
row = height(picture);
column = width(picture);

%Converts array from uint8 to double
picture = double(picture);

%Creates empty array for greypic (output)
greypic = zeros(row,column);

%Creates a for loop to cycle through each row and each column 
     for i = 1:row
         for j = 1:column
 
%Calculates the ratios of the red, green, and blue values of the RGB image
            red = picture(i,j,1) * (3/9);
             green = picture(i,j,2) * (5/9);
             blue = picture(i,j,3) * (1/9);
 
%Calculates greyscale pixel value for each pixel in the array
             greypic(i,j) = (red + green + blue);
        
        end
     end

%Converts output array from double to uint8
greypic = uint8(greypic);
 
 end
