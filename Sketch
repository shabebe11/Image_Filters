function [sketch_img] = Sketch(img, intensity)

%Sketch takes an image and converts it into a sketch_like image by using
%greyscale,inersion, and blurring

%Input: 
%img: m-by-n-by-k uint8 array representing a RGB or greyscale image
%intensity: positive, odd, integer definining intensity of bluring

%Output: 
% sketch_img: m-by-n-by-k uint8 array representing the sketch_like image

%Calculates number of layers from input array
[~,~,layer] = size(img);

%If input image is RGB use Greyscale function to convert it to greyscale
if layer>1  
    grey_img = Greyscale(img);
%If image is already greyscale leave it as it is
else
    grey_img = img;
end

%Invert image and then Blur it
img = Invert(grey_img);
img = Blur(img, intensity);

%Convert inverted, blurred, greyscale image and original greyscale image
%to double
img = double(img);
grey_img = double(grey_img);

%Creates a output array of zeros
sketch_img = zeros(size(grey_img));

%Calculates the array values when back image has value of les than 255
sketch_img(grey_img<255) = (255 * img(grey_img<255)) ./ (255 - grey_img(grey_img<255));

%Calculaates the array values when back image is equal to 255
sketch_img(grey_img==255) = 255;

%Convert sketch_img array from double to uint8
sketch_img = uint8(sketch_img);
