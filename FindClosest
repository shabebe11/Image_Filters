function [closest] = FindClosest(position,rowarr,colarr)

%FindClosest finds the closest pixel from given row and column
%co-ordinates to a given position

%Input: 
%position: 1-by-2 double vector representing the position of a pixel
%rowarr: 1-by-n double array representing row co-ordinates of a set of
%pixels
%colarr: 1-by-n double array representing column co-ordinates of a set of
%pixels

%Output: 
% closest: 1-by-2 double vector representing position of closest pixel

%Calculate the number co-ordinates given
column = width(colarr);

%Seperates position vector into its row and column value
posrow = position(1,1);
poscol = position(1,2);

%Creates a empty array for values to go into
d = zeros(1,column); 

%for loop to go through each vaalue of rowarr and colarr
for j= 1:column

%finds distances between the rows and columns between position and
%co-ordinate
        d_row = ((rowarr(1,j) - posrow)^2);
        d_col = ((colarr(1,j) - poscol)^2);

%Finds total distance between row and co-ordinate
        d(1,j) = sqrt(d_row + d_col);
        

end

%Finds the co-ordinate that is closest to the position
[~, min_pos] = min(d);

%Outputs a vector containing the co-ordinates of the closest point to the
%position input
closest = [rowarr(1,min_pos),colarr(1,min_pos)];
